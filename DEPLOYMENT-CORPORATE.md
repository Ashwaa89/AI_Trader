# Corporate Firewall Deployment Guide

## ðŸš« Blocked Services
Your corporate firewall blocks all major cloud hosting platforms:
- GitHub (github.com)
- Vercel (vercel.com)
- Netlify (netlify.com)
- Railway (railway.app)
- Render (render.com)

## ðŸ’¡ Corporate-Friendly Deployment Options

### Option 1: Microsoft Azure (Recommended for Corporate)
If your company has Microsoft 365/Azure licensing:
1. **Azure Static Web Apps** - Often pre-approved in corporate environments
2. **Azure App Service** - Full-stack hosting with Node.js support
3. Contact your IT department about Azure access

### Option 2: Internal Corporate Hosting
1. **SharePoint Online** - For static file hosting
2. **Internal web servers** - Contact IT for internal hosting options
3. **Corporate intranet** - Deploy within company network

### Option 3: Portable Application Package
1. **Local HTTP Server** - Run locally with Node.js
2. **Network share deployment** - Share with colleagues on corporate network
3. **Standalone executable** - Package as Windows app

### Option 4: External Device Deployment
1. **Personal laptop/device** with home internet
2. **Mobile hotspot** deployment
3. **Coffee shop/public WiFi** deployment

## ðŸ“¦ Creating Deployment Package

### For Local/Network Deployment:
```powershell
# Install Node.js dependencies (if npm is available)
npm install

# Start local server
node server.js

# Access at: http://localhost:3001
```

### For Static File Deployment:
Your application can run as static files with:
- `index.html` - Main application
- `script.js` - Application logic
- `styles.css` - Styling
- Mock data endpoints (no external APIs needed)

## ðŸ”§ IT Department Questions to Ask:
1. "Do we have Azure Static Web Apps access?"
2. "Can I host a Node.js application internally?"
3. "What are approved hosting platforms?"
4. "Can I get exception access for vercel.app domain?"
5. "Do we have internal web server options?"

## ðŸ“± Mobile Deployment Alternative:
Since external deployment is blocked, consider:
1. **Mobile app wrapper** (Cordova/PhoneGap)
2. **Progressive Web App** (PWA) for offline use
3. **Electron desktop app** for Windows distribution

## âš¡ Quick Local Setup:
```powershell
# Navigate to project folder
cd "C:\Solutions\Stock Trader"

# Install dependencies (if available)
npm install express cors dotenv

# Start server
node server.js

# Open browser to: http://localhost:3001
```

Your application works perfectly offline with mock data!
